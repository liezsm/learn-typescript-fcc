## Why Typescript?

Typescript is a powerful superset of Javascript that adds static typing, making it easier to catch errors early in the development process and provide better documentation for the codebase. It also provides features such as interfaces, classes, and modules, which help to organize and structure code.

As a developer, I am always looking for ways to improve the quality and maintainability of my code, and Typescript provides a great solution for achieving these goals.

## Getting Started

To get started with Typescript, I followed the steps outlined in the video tutorial, which included:

1. Installing Typescript using NPM:

npm install -g typescript
